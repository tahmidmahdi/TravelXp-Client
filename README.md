## About This Project

We have implemented security in this site. Private Routing is a part of it. A user can not book any event if he/she isn't signned in. Firebase  Google SignIn  is implemented for security. We have also added 'Book'  pannel where a user can Book His/Her preferred event.A review panel is also added to give review. We have upload images in imgbb server and generates a dynamic img link.
Role based Authentication is also implemented.  We can also delete a event but a user must need to be logged in and must be an admin.
